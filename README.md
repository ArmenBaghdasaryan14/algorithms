# Algorithms

This repository contains implementation of algorithms in **Python** and may be extended to other languages in future (**C++**, **TypeScript**). \
The main source of theory behind is the ["Introduction to Algorithms"](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/books/Introduction.to.Algorithms.4th.Leiserson.Stein.Rivest.Cormen.MIT.Press.9780262046305.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf) book (commonly known as "CLRS"), by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein.

The motivation behind this work is the practise and understanding of those algorithm fundamentals.
